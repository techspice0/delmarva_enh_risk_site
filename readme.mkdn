## The Delmarva enhanced risk (3/5) of 6/19/25 ~7:00pm

### Inferences:
the storms that impacted the delmarva penninsula originated in central maryland/virginia then crossed the chesepeake to the delmarva


the storm bases were higher compared to other storms i hae seen in past severe weather events, likely due to a lower due point.

the storms came in waves that looked like a broken squall line on radar

They moved from SW to NE
